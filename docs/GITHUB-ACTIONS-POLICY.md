# GitHub Actions Policy

GitHub Actions in AgentPanelSpeaker.NET exist to validate checked-in repository
state and publish immutable CI result tags.  They are not a remote editor for
production source, tests, or documentation.

## Permanent workflow set

Maintained repository lines may contain only these workflow paths:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — explicit request-gated repository CI and result
  tag publication.
- `.github/workflows/core-integration-validation.yml` — read-only validation of
  AgentPanelSpeaker against its pinned AIConversationCore integration contract.
- `.github/workflows/repository-task.yml` — read-only execution of checked-in
  repository tasks.

`ci.yml` is required on the main line.  The integration and repository-task
workflows are optional on maintained integration lineages where those
responsibilities exist.

Issue-specific, temporary, migration, repair, patch, RED/GREEN application,
instrumentation, or other one-shot workflows are prohibited.  Development
changes must be made through a normal checked-out working tree or the GitHub
repository API/connector, not by an Action that rewrites and commits project
files.

## Repository-write exception

The current main-line CI may receive `contents: write` only in its finalization
job, and only to publish the tested result tag through:

`python scripts/ci_contract.py finalize ... --tag --push`

The workflow must not run direct `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` commands,
or direct mutating GitHub/cURL API calls.  Core integration validation and
repository-task workflows must remain read-only.

## Enforcement

`scripts/check_actions_policy.py` enforces the workflow allow-list and write
restrictions.  `tests/test_actions_policy.py` supplies positive and negative
regression coverage, including the actual checked-out workflow set.

The permanent CI workflow is triggered by changes under `.github/workflows/**`
and by changes to the policy checker/tests.  Its lightweight Linux policy job
always runs for those changes.  The expensive Windows validation matrix remains
explicitly request-gated: it proceeds only when `.ci/run-ci-request` changed in
the push or when CI was manually dispatched.

An in-repository check cannot prevent GitHub from registering or scheduling a
brand-new unauthorized workflow from the same commit before another workflow
reports the policy failure.  Repository rulesets/review controls are the only
way to prevent that first scheduling event entirely.  The repository guard
nevertheless makes accidental violations deterministic and keeps maintained
write paths behind the policy check.

Historical workflow runs are separate GitHub Actions metadata.  Purging obsolete
run history does not rewrite Git history or change commit SHAs.
